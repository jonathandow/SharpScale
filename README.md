ECE 49022 - The Sharp Scale

The Sharp Scale is a breakthrough kitchen innovation which streamlines the cooking process for the busy lifestyle of the everyday person. This state-of-the-art kitchen assistant is a combination of a cutting board and a digital scale which brings a new level of precision and efficiency to cooking. This product includes an interactive display for video tutorials with user customizable recipes and comes with mobile app support for the more tech savvy users. The Sharp Scale also comes equipped with a detachable cutting/weighing surface, making the cutting board easy to wash. It is extremely versatile as it allows the user to measure ingredients without requiring measuring cups. Keeping beginner chefs in mind, the Sharp Scale turns the kitchen into an efficient learning environment, making home cooking more accessible and fun. 

Note: When running BLESerivce.py, you must clone the Bluez github repository in the same folder as the script. You must also run BLEService.py FIRST, and then run GATTServer.py.
